# Dog Breed Detection

This is one of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program projects.

We'll build a CNN model to detect the breed of a dog. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

The dataset is provided by Udacity.
